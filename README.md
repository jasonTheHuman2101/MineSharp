# MineSharp
Minecraft Server Management

## What Is MineSharp?
MineSharp is a program that can provide a UI to control your minecraft server. The simple user interface means that you are able to control your server with ease.
Players can be managed at a click using the Toolbox window, which provides you with a list of players, and controls to manage them.

The main window provides a console to send commands and view the server I/O easily. Also, there is an indicator to show the state of the server at a glance.

## Installation
To install, simply download a release, or compile the source code. Run the EXE and provide a path to the server's folder. Ensure the server's .JAR file is named "server.jar"

Have Fun!
